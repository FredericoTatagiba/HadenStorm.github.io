		<p class="Talk">So... You found my secret...<br>If you have found this, that means you want to know more about me right?<br>So...<br>My real name is Frederico Ferreira Tatagiba, I'm from Brazil and I'm in the first period of Computer Science, I chose this course after I made some contact with programming while I was doing Mechanical Engineering at UVV. So I chose to change and follow my new path, wich is Computer Science. But no, it wasn't suddenly, I was already thinking about doing this since second period, but I was too undecided if this was what I really wanted you know? Like when you have 60 seconds to choose a character in a fight game! But... That was making me unhappy and unhappy and... REALLY unhappy, so I've finally made my choice, and in April of 2018 I locked Mechanical Engineering and transfered to Computer Science! And now I can say that I'm truly happy.</p>
